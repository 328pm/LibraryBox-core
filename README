Preparation of the core scripts for LibraryBox on RapsberryPI and OpenWRT.
The Scripts are designed for reusing and modificate only the base Piratebox Scripts instead of being a HARD fork from PBx.

To achieve this, LibraryBox uses the hook implementation (preprepared empty scripts for you own code) and exchanges a few files, if needed.


The workflow for creating the final source package is:

  - clone this project
  - do your modification in the "customization" folder
  - run the following command, which results the final "compilation" of all scripts into the directory "build" (changes made during build, see below)
    make build
  - To create an script package
     # OpenWRT imagefile:  make image
     # Script package   :  make targz
     # all together     :  make all

  - To cleanup your build environment:
     make clean


Folders
-------

  customization    =  All stuff which should be copied over
  piratebox_origin =  git subtree of PirateBoxScripts_Webserver branch "librarybox_dev"  (see git subtree"
                      Normally you would choose some stable release, but because of LibraryBox is leapfrogging PirateBox I need to base on special branch to able to push changes back and other way around. This can be later changed to "stable" branch


Changes during build
--------------------

* Place normal configuration and script hooks, which are used
* Copy a template for the librarybox.us/  stuff (internet detection and so on)
* Copy a template for the content-folder librarybox.us/content 
* Changing SSD in hostapd
