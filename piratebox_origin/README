Starting / Stopping PirateBox
WARNING: Some major distributions have changed from init.d to systemd which means you should use the 
commands that are labeled under your distribution or what your distribution is based on. It should 
also be noted that as of recently Ubuntu has systemd enabled but not set as the default init system
which means that you may have to use the systemctl commands.

Newest versions of Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, OpenSUSE, Mageia, and Mandriva:
$ systemctl start piratebox
$ systemctl start piratebox
$ systemctl restart piratebox

Older Ubuntu (xubuntu, lubuntu, etc), Mint, Debian, most Debian based distros: 
$ service piratebox start
